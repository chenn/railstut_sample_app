# Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App

This is a [sample application](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/static-pages?version=3.2#top) for a [tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/) I'm following on Ruby on Rails.

### Changes

I've changed a few of the things the normal tutorial suggests:

* erb templates are now haml templates
* I used bootstrap-sass instead of Blueprint for a css framework
